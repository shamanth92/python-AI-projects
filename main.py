# This app implements the same RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline twice,
# side by side, for learning purposes:
#   1. "basicRag"    -> hand-rolled pipeline (no LangChain), see services/rag_services/
#   2. "langChainRag" -> same pipeline built with LangChain, see services/langchain_rag_services/
# Both ingest PDFs into their own ChromaDB collection and answer questions using
# retrieved context + an OpenAI chat model. Compare the two implementations to see
# what LangChain abstracts away (prompt chaining, retriever interface, etc.).

# Each router is self-contained: it owns its own prefix, tags, and error handling.
